Here I make a Ai computer Vision project, that have Customer Face Detection and Voice-Activated Data Update


Architecture Diagram- (Camera Input → Face Detection → Face Recognition → Voice Command → Data Display)

Tools & Technologies- (
Python
OpenVINO Toolkit – optimized face detection
Vosk – offline voice recognition
OpenCV – image processing
Tkinter / Custom GUI – for display
SQLite / JSON – for storing customer data
)

face detection pretrained model-( face-reidentification-retail-0095.xml
                                 face-reidentification-retail-0095.bin
                                 face-detection-adas-0001.xml
                                 face-detection-adas-0001.bin)

  All you have to do run main.py
